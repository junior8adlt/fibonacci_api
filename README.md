# Fibonacci Api

This project was carried out in order to create an **FibonacciApi ** for the ControlHub Software Engineering Candidate Quiz.

## Prerequisites

To run the server it is necessary to have installed:

- **NodeJS** in the version **12.18.x** [NodeJs](https://nodejs.org/en/blog/release/v12.18.4/).
- **NPM** in the version **6.14.x**

## Settings âš™

### Environment Variables

In the root of the project there is a file **.env** with the possibility of configuring the port in which the project runs.
Default is: 4000

## Running the server

Once the above is installed and configured, the following command should be run:

```
npm install
```

This project uses nodemon to facilitate the initialization of the project in development mode, as follows:

```
npm run start:dev
```

If it is not required to initialize the project with nodemon, it can be done as follows:

```
npm run start
```

## Documentation

At the root of the project there is a folder with the name of **doc** in which there is a collection of [Postman](https://www.postman.com/downloads/) It contains the endpoints with their respective examples.

## Additional Comments
I don't consider myself a REST API developer.
But I have plenty of experience working with Node, HTTP, and REST protocols. I used to be a Fullstack developer long time ago.
**Technical decisions**
I decided not to leave a limit on the Fibonacci function because it must be readable to perform queries with large numbers.
